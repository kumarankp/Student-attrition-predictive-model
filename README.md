# Student-attrition-predictive-model
Capstone Project 
AGENDA:
To build a predective ML model to predict which kind of student will leave the college within one year of course.
Type of problem : CLASSIFICATION Problem [Bi-class Target variable]
Algorithm : Logistic Model & Random Forest Classifier.
Metrics : ROC AUC Score.
Accuracy : 79.23% on test data.

NTERPRETATION
Unmet Percent: Increase in unmet student need percent, Increase in likelihood that the student will leave the college within one year.

S_1_Course_notelected: Students who are not elected any course for 1st course of Second term, Increase in likelihood that student will leave the college within one year.

S_2_Course_notelected: Students who are not elected any course for 2nd course of Second term, Increase in likelihood that student will leave the college within one year.

S_Attained_percent: Increase in Attained percent on Second term, Increase the likelihood that student will continue for the next semester. Students who have lesser Attained percent on Second term, are most likely to leave the college.

ST_2007: Students who enrolled in the batch of 2007, are most likely to continue the college for next semester.

S_Grade _B (1st & 2nd course): Students who secured Grade B on 1st and 2nd course, increase in likelihood that student will continue the college for next semester.

SUGGESTIONS
DISTANCE FROM HOME :

Admit more number of students who have the home in the distance of 85 km or lesser from college, those students have more likelihood to continue the college.
Reduce admitting the students who have more than 115 km in distance, more likely to leave the college.
